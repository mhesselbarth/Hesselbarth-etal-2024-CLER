\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Landscapes are typically defined as mosaics of different land covers,
habitats, ecosystems, or land use systems (Forman and Godron 1986;
Forman 1995) - with empathize on heterogeneity of at least one factor of
interest (Turner and Gardner 2015). Linking spatial heterogeneity and
ecological processes, including potential feedbacks, is the fundamental
concept of landscape ecology (Risser et al. 1984; Turner 1989, 2005).
Typical research topics include ecological flows in landscape mosaics,
drivers and consequences of land use and land cover (LULC) change,
nonlinear dynamics and landscape complexity, scale and scaling, spatial
analysis and landscape modeling, linking landscape metrics to ecological
processes, integrating humans and their activities into landscape
ecology, landscape conservation and sustainability, or accuracy
assessment and uncertainty analysis (Wu and Hobbs 2002; Wu 2013).

Computational science involves analyzing abstracted core mechanisms of
research questions using data and algorithms. Thus, computational
ecology can be defined as computational science that is used to address
ecological research questions with focus on complex, adaptive systems
and data-driven approaches (Poisot et al. 2019). Computational ecology
in general and simulations specifically are of importance for ecology
because ecological data is often context- and scale-dependent and
unfeasible to study in controllable, reproducible, and replicable
experimental settings (Petrovskii and Petrovskaya 2012; but see Wiersma
2022). Because landscape ecology is a cross-disciplinary field including
(e.g., social sciences, geography, or ecology and evolution; Wiens 1997;
With 2019), the general increase of data availability (Chi et al. 2016;
Jarić et al. 2020; Wüest et al. 2020; Nathan et al. 2022), or the
studied complex landscape systems (Newman et al. 2019), there is the
need for sophisticated computational methods in order to link
heterogeneity patterns and ecological processes. Thus, computational
methods are one of the most important tools of modern scientific
research (Prlić and Procter 2012; Wilson et al. 2014).

For all computational methods the natural world must be translated into
representative data models. The spatial vector data model is based on
points, lines, and polygons features that are defined by their geometry
and additional attributes related to them. Contrastingly, the raster
data model is based on evenly-spaced grid cells and discrete or
continuous values related to each cell (Lovelace et al. 2019; With
2019). The choice of the data models, spatial and temporal scales, or
the thematic resolution are crucial for the analysis (Wade et al. 2003;
Lechner and Rhodes 2016; Nedd et al. 2021).

Here, we aim to introduce the latest developments of computational
methods in landscape ecology. However, we do not provide a systematic
literature review, or a general introduction to (computational)
landscape ecology. For a more comprehensive, general introductions to
landscape ecology, please see Turner and Gardner (2015), Gergel and
Turner (2017), or With (2019). First, we will introduce recent
computational developments of the most important topics of landscape
ecology. This includes, for example, spatial patterns quantification,
connectivity and movement, or model simulations. Second, we will
introduce common software tools that implement or are potentially
capable of implementing these developments. However, due to its many
advantages (Powers and Hampton 2019), we will focus on open-source
software , and specifically scripting languages, i.e., R, Python, and
Julia. Last, we will discuss potential future needs developments of
computational methods in landscape ecology.

\section{Spatial patterns}\label{spatial-patterns}

Spatial patterns can be defined as the scale-dependent predictability of
the physical arrangement of observations (Dale 1999), or as clearly
identifiable structures in nature itself or data extracted from nature
(Grimm et al. 1996). Importantly, patterns observed in nature contain
information about the history of the system, such as demographic
processes, dispersal characteristics, or climatic patterns (Wiegand et
al. 2003). However, spatial patterns are not only a result of processes,
but could also be a driver of them. Thus, untangling the history of a
landscape and linking its spatial patterns to ecological processes is
one of the core concepts of landscape ecology (Turner 1989).

\subsection{Landscape metrics}\label{landscape-metrics}

Traditionally and still the most prominent approaches to quantify
spatial patterns revolve around raster data using categorical categories
based on the patch mosaic model (Frazier and Kedron 2017; Costanza et
al. 2019). The strength of landscape metrics is that they are comparable
easy to apply and communicate (Lausch et al. 2015), however, they are
also critiqued for not being able to realistically represent continuous
features of the natural word (Frazier and Kedron 2017). Metrics can be
calculated on patch-level (describing each patch), class-level
(describing all patches of the same class), or landscape level
(describing the entire landscape) and are able to quantify
characteristics related to e.g., patch areas and edge lengths, patch
shapes, or class aggregation and diversity (Hesselbarth et al. 2019).
Recently also several metrics describing landscape complexity were
introduced, e.g., several entropy measures (see following sections).

\subsection{Entropy}\label{entropy}

It is mainly derived from information theory and thermodynamics, such as
Shannon entropy (and its analogous forms), Boltzmann entropy, or Renyi
entropy. Entropy in landscape ecology is mainly used to quantify the
complexity of the landscape (spatial heterogeneity), and less often
unpredictability (temporal heterogeneity) and scale dependence
(spatio-temporal heterogeneity; Vranken et al. 2015). However, studies
show that insights do not only depend on the formulation of the used
entropy, but also on the underlining data model, for example the
composition of categories or the co-occurrence matrix (Zhao and Zhang
2019).

The Shannon diversity index (Shannon 1948) quantifies the richness and
evenness of categories in the landscape omitting spatial configuration.
The index is based on information theory and is an adaptation of the
Shannon entropy which measures uncertainty of a random variable.
Shannon's entropy formula can also be modified to include the
landscape's spatial configuration, e.g., by weights calculated from
intra- and inter-class distances (Claramunt 2012). However, to quantify
the spatial configuration and the total complexity of the landscape,
other measures from information theory can be adapted. Nowosad and
Stepinski (2019) proposed to treat categorical raster as a bivariate
random variable \((x,y)\) where \(x\) is the category of the focal cell
and \(y\) is the category of the neighboring cell. This approach allows
us to compress information about the landscape's composition and
configuration into a co-occurrence matrix, which could be used to
calculate various entropy measures. This includes conditional entropy
(representing configurational complexity), joint entropy (representing
overall spatial-thematic complexity), mutual information, and relative
mutual information (representing the degree of spatial autocorrelation).

Based on notions from thermodynamics initiated by the work of Cushman
(2015) or Vranken et al. (2015), there was a surge in the development of
entropy-based metrics for landscape ecology in the last few years. In
the late 1800s, Boltzmann formulated a probabilistic interpretation of
the second law of thermodynamics using the concepts of macrostate (the
general state of a system) and microstate (the configuration of the
system elements; Gao and Li 2019). Cushman (2016) proposed to relate the
edge length to the microstate of the landscape, and use the proportion
of microstates to compute the relative Boltzmann entropy of a landscape
mosaic. This approach was generalized for calculations based on raster's
surface model and point patterns (Cushman 2021). Subsequently, Gao et
al. (2017) proposed to use the Boltzmann entropy to quantify the
complexity of a landscape surface by transforming the input raster into
a series of landscape surfaces with different levels of detail
(microstate) and calculating the Boltzmann entropy based on the total
number of microstates that are able to generate the observed macrostate.
Recently, Zhang et al. (2020) extended the original definition of
Boltzmann entropy to incorporate information about the adjacency of the
same categories in the landscape mosaic by using the number of
contiguous patches of the same category.

Moreover, many other entropy-based metrics have been proposed for use in
landscape ecology. The Renyi (Rényi 1961) and Gibbs entropies , which
are both generalizations of the Shannon entropy, are applied to quantify
the complexity of the landscape. The Rao quadratic entropy (Rao 1982)
has also been applied recently (Rocchini et al. 2017), as it measures
not only the relative abundances of elements, but also the pairwise
dissimilarities or distances between them. Thus, it can be useful in
cases, when the dissimilarities between LULC types, and not only their
categories, are relevant. Another recent development is the use of
Kullback-Leibler divergence (also known as relative entropy), which is a
measure of differences between two probability distributions to describe
patterns across scales (Huckeba et al. 2023).

\subsection{Operations on spatial
patterns}\label{operations-on-spatial-patterns}

Spatial patterns can be analyzed through a range of computational
operations, such as comparing, searching, or grouping (Turner 1990;
Wickham and Norton 1994; Jasiewicz et al. 2015; Remmel 2020; Nowosad
2021). These operations are based on spatial signatures which are
multi-numerical representations of landscape pattern, and dissimilarity
measures which are functions that quantify differences between the
signatures.

Spatial patterns can be compared between different areas, or for the
same area at two different moments in time. Comparing spatial patterns
is often used to analyze landscape dynamics, e.g., to detect changes in
landscape structure over time (Duncan and Boruff 2023). Furthermore,
pattern-based search is a one-to-many operation in which the spatial
signature of a query area is compared to the signatures of all other
areas. This allows to find areas with similar patterns compared to the
query area, e.g., areas with similar environmental conditions (Jasiewicz
et al. 2014). Finally, the grouping of spatial patterns is a
many-to-many operation in which spatial signatures are calculated for
all areas and clustered based on their similarity (Nowosad and Stepinski
2021).

\subsection{Landscape mosaic}\label{landscape-mosaic}

Despite the extensive use of the landscape mosaic model and metrics
based on it, major limitations have been identified regarding both its
ability to quantify the spatial structure of landscapes and their
relationship to ecological processes (Gustafson 1998; Li and Wu 2004;
Dramstad 2009; Kupfer 2012; Lausch et al. 2015; Frazier and Kedron
2017). Here, we review four major issues of landscape metrics, namely
their sensitivity to both spatial scale and thematic resolution,
redundancy and interpretation (Dramstad 2009).

\subsubsection{Sensitivity to spatial scale and thematic
resolution}\label{sensitivity-to-spatial-scale-and-thematic-resolution}

Identifying scales at which the ecological processes of interest operate
is a critical first step towards establishing relationships between
pattern and process (Levin 1992; Wu 2007; Cushman and McGarigal 2008).
To that end, a key requirement is to understand the sensitivity of
landscape metrics to spatial scale in terms of both grain and extent.

A key concept to consider regarding grain size is the minimum mapping
unit (MMU), namely the smallest area entity that can be mapped and
analyzed as a discrete patch. Since the input maps should represent not
only the location of patches but also their shape, the grain size should
be several times smaller than the smallest patch (i.e., the MMU) in
order to quantify shapes. Even though the MMU is often assumed as a
natural characteristic of the dataset, it has an impact on the computed
landscape metrics, especially on the number of patches and their size
distribution (Saura 2002).

While the choice of grain is often constrained by the available data,
e.g., Landsat scenes at 30 m resolution, the selection of spatial extent
varies largely depending on the phenomenon of interest, e.g., from large
transects of forests in natural parks to small buffers along the
urban-rural gradient. The spatial extent and sampling strategy is often
subject to many arbitrary criteria that can largely influence results.
This issue has long been recognized in physical geography as the
modifiable areal unit problem {[}MAUP; Openshaw (1979); Openshaw
(1984){]}. Dealing with the MAUP in the context of landscape metrics
include the identification of individual entities that are ecologically
meaningful and not modifiable, the evaluation of ``optimal'' zoning
systems that maximize interzonal variations and minimize intrazonal
variation, and the analysis of the sensitivity of the zoning
configuration (Jelinski and Wu 1996; Duque et al. 2018; Fletcher Jr et
al. 2023).

The scale effects of landscape metrics can be assessed by computing
scalograms, i.e., the response curves of metrics to changing scales.
Some metrics related to the number of patches, edges show consistent
linear and power-law scaling relationships to changing grain, while
other metrics exhibit less predictable responses (Turner et al. 1989;
Saura and Martínez-Millán 2001; Wu et al. 2002; Wu 2004; Saura and
Castro 2007; Šı́mová and Gdulová 2012; Argañaraz and Entraigas 2014;
Frazier et al. 2021). Nonetheless, the effects of changing the sampling
extent can be less predictable than those of changing grain size (Wu
2004). For instance, in landscapes with small extent to grain ratio,
boundary effects are likely to dominate and truncate patches resulting
in unreliable metric computations. In order to address scale issues,
studies should explicitly consider the concept of scope, namely the
ratio of extent to resolution (Schneider 2001). This involves three
fundamental steps, i) considering scope guidelines when designing
experiments, ii) explicitly reporting grain and extent allowing
quantitative scope comparisons with other studies, iii) and comparisons
and replications based on scope (Frazier 2023).

\subsubsection{Redundancy}\label{redundancy}

TODO

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Factor analysis of Riitters et al. (Riitters et al. 1995) found six
  main components: average patch compaction, image texture, average
  patch shape, patch perimeter-area scaling, number of attribute classes
  and large-patch density-area scaling.
\item
  Cushman et al. (Cushman et al. 2008) not only isolate the components
  but also assess their strength (proportion of variance explained),
  universality (how present they are accross landscapes) and consistency
  (how stable they are accross landscapes). At the class level, they
  find seven ``highly universal and consistent structure components''
  (page 700), namely edge contrast, patch shape complexity, aggregation,
  nearest neighbor distance, patch dispersion, large patch dominance and
  neighborhood similarity. At the landscape level, five components are
  identified, namely contagion/diversity (similar to image texture in
  Riitters et al. (Riitters et al. 1995), large patch dominance,
  interspersion/juxtaposition, edge contrast, patch shape variability,
  proximity and nearest neighbor distance. Overall, components are more
  consistent and universal at the landscape level than at the class
  level.
\item
  Uuemaa et al. (Uuemaa et al. 2011) find four main components:
  dominance (also identified by Riitters et al. (Riitters et al. 1995)
  and Cushman et al. (Cushman et al. 2008)), contrast, shape complexity
  and composition.
\item
  Amount (composition) and adjacency (configuration) are the fundamental
  elements of pattern (Riitters 2019)
\item
  Entropy (Nowosad and Stepinski 2019)
\item
  Spatial signatures (Nowosad 2021)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Interpretability}\label{interpretability}

TODO - do landscape metrics measure fragmentation? - normalized metrics
(Wang and Cumming 2011) - (Frazier et al. 2021)

Responses: - incorporating aspects of ecological function into landscape
metrics (e.g., core area, least-cost distances) and moving towards
graph-based and circuit theory approaches (Kupfer 2012). - point-data
analysis (Gustafson 1998) and gradient surface model (Lausch et al.
2015) require fewer assumptions regarding LULC categorization schemes or
spatial scale

\subsection{Surface metrics}\label{surface-metrics}

Surface metrics are based on the gradient surface model using raster
data and continuous values (McGarigal et al. 2009; Cushman et al. 2010)
and were adapted from microscopy and molecular physics (McGarigal et al.
2009; Kedron et al. 2018). The gradient surface model can increase the
resemblance of the data model and the natural world because it allows to
include more heterogeneity within each grid cell (Cushman et al. 2010;
Kedron et al. 2018). Surface metrics are able to quantify various
characteristics, such as roughness, skewness and kurtosis, total and
relative amplitudes, curvatures of local peaks, or surface bearing area
ratios (Cushman et al. 2010). Many surface metrics have analogous
landscape metrics (Cushman et al. 2010), however, using surface metrics
allows to reveal different or additional patterns and potentially
pattern-process links (McGarigal et al. 2009; Borthwick et al. 2020).
Yet, software to calculate these metrics is still rare and further
research is needed into the specific pattern-process links and
ecological meaningful interpretations (Kedron et al. 2018; Frazier
2019).

\subsection{Vector metrics}\label{vector-metrics}

Many landscape ecology studies are based on the raster data model.
However, the decision on the data model is often driven by data and
software availability, or the familiarity with the approach (Costanza et
al. 2019). For example, many LULC maps are provided as raster as they
often related to underlying remote sensing products. Yet, nowadays,
vector data is increasingly available, and most geospatial software
supports it.

Hundreds of metrics have already been developed for raster data, so the
most straightforward approach is to reimplement the same metrics for
vector data. This is possible for most of the metrics, with only several
exceptions of metrics that are specifically related to the raster data
model (Yao et al. 2022). Yet, the vector data model has been widely used
in other fields, such as geography or urban studies. For example, in
urban planning vector metrics are applied to quantify the shapes of
urban areas and characterize the complexity of building footprints
(Basaraner and Cetinkaya 2017). Earlier approaches included four
categories of compactness measures for vector data, namely
perimeter-area, single parameters of related circles, dispersion of
elements of the area around a centroid, and direct comparison to
standard shapes (Maceachren 1985). More recently, a unified theoretical
foundation for measuring shape compactness was introduced using a set of
ten distinct properties of a circle and metrics associated with each of
these properties (Angel et al. 2010)

Vector-based metrics also have their limitations. The most important is
computational complexity, which makes calculations of vector metrics
slower than their raster equivalents. Another technical issue is the
need for the data to be topologically correct, which is often
problematic especially for data from different sources. Last, the
pattern-process link is still less explored for vector-based metrics
compared to raster-based metrics.

\section{Connectivity}\label{connectivity}

Connectivity describes how movement among resources patches is
facilitated or hindered by landscape features such as types, amounts,
and arrangement of LULC (Taylor et al. 1993, 2006). While structural
connectivity focuses on physical and spatial relationships among
resource patches, functional connectivity also includes the movement or
flow of individuals and populations through the landscape (Taylor et al.
2006). Connectivity underpins ecosystem functionality and maintains
biodiversity and populations, and plays a large role in many
conservation actions (Correa Ayram et al. 2016; Hilty et al. 2020).
Thus, in the past multiple approaches how to measure connectivity were
developed (Simpkins et al. 2018; Keeley et al. 2021).

\subsection{Landscape metrics}\label{landscape-metrics-1}

There are several landscape metrics that are traditionally used to
measure landscape connectivity. For example, the habitat amount within a
buffer zone of focal patches, the nearest-neighbor distance, or the
connectance index (Moilanen and Nieminen 2002; Prugh 2009; Spanowicz and
Jaeger 2019). However, these metrics are frequently criticised for being
to simple and especially the link to functional connectivity is often
ambiguous. Thus, more functionality needs to be included using
additional ecological meaningful metrics, such as the core area (e.g.,
Kupfer 2012). More recently there is also an increasing focus in
within-patch connectivity using metrics such as the effective mesh size
in addition to the usual measure between-patch connectivity (Spanowicz
and Jaeger 2019).

\subsection{Resistance surfaces}\label{resistance-surfaces}

Resistance surfaces are one of the most popular approaches to model
connectivity and developed from simple isolation-by-distance approaches.
The approach uses environmental layers and biodiversity data or expert
opinions to estimate the cost and of movement through landscapes (Zeller
et al. 2012). The latest developments of resistance surfaces have
recently been reviewed (Dutta et al. 2022). The resistance surface can
be used to model movement based on different approaches such as
leas-cost paths (Adriaensen et al. 2003; Etherington 2016) or circuit
theory (McRae et al. 2008). However, resistance surfaces are not free of
critique including missing spatial-temporal variability or context
dependency (Unnithan Kumar et al. 2022b; Unnithan Kumar and Cushman
2022). Thus, recent developments include the combination with more
processes-based modelling approaches (Schumaker and Brookes 2018; Bocedi
et al. 2021; Unnithan Kumar et al. 2022a), modelling of dynamic
landscape connectivity (Zeller et al. 2020), inclusion of stochasticity
and spatial context (Ribeiro et al. 2017), using genetic optimization
algorithms (Peterman 2018), or computational improvements (Leonard et
al. 2017).

\subsection{Graph theory}\label{graph-theory}

Graph theory describes a landscape as a set of nodes representing
habitat patches and edges as potential links between the nodes. Thus,
graph theory is a powerful tool to model landscape connectivity,
especially in a metapopulation context (Urban and Keitt 2001).

\subsection{Other approaches}\label{other-approaches}

\section{Simulation models}\label{simulation-models}

Simulation models are a powerful tool to study complex adaptive
ecological systems in controllable, reproducible, and replicable
settings (Pascual 2005; Petrovskii and Petrovskaya 2012). Thus, they can
be seen as experimental systems that allow, unlike to the natural world,
all imaginable manipulations in order to advance theoretical
developments or test hypotheses (Peck 2004). Due to the usual temporal
and spatial scales, complex interactions and feedbacks, or scale
mismatches between patterns and processes, simulation models are one of
the major approaches in landscape ecology (Schröder and Seppelt 2006;
Synes et al. 2016). In general, simulations models can be classified
using two major divisions, namely as \emph{i)} predictive or exploratory
models, and \emph{ii)} pattern- or process-based models (Peck 2004;
Synes et al. 2016). Here, we are going to focus mainly on exploratory
models, but include both pattern- and process-based models.

\subsection{Landscapes simulators}\label{landscapes-simulators}

Landscape simulators are typically used as null hypotheses, baselines,
or scenarios because they allow to control certain aspects of the
landscape (Li et al. 2004; Wang and Malanson 2008) and are generally
simpler than ecological simulations models (Hess et al. 2020). Landscape
simulators can be classified into two major categories, namely
pattern-based and process-based approaches (Pe'er et al. 2013;
Langhammer et al. 2019).

Pattern-based approaches simulate landscapes without assuming any
underlying abiotic or biotic processes (i.e., neutral landscape model;
Gardner et al. 1987). The earliest neutral models are based on
percolation theory and assign LULC types randomly to cells in the
landscape(Gardner et al. 1987) or hierarchical models that consider
different spatial scales while assigning cell values (O'Neill et al.
1992). Landscapes characterized by continuous values can be simulated by
fractal models, such as Brownian motion (Palmer 1992). Borrowing from
computer graphics, more recent neutral landscape models make use of
spectral synthesis (e.g., Perlin noise; Etherington 2022) or binary
space partitioning (Etherington et al. 2022). Neutral landscape models
are also able to simulate landscapes dominated by anthropogenic
activities using based on least-cost networks (Etherington et al. 2024).
In order to ensure realistic neutral landscapes several approaches exist
that use comparisons with real landscapes (Inkoom et al. 2017) or are
based on target values optimization (Van Strien et al. 2016;
Justeau-Allaire et al. 2022).

Contrastingly, processes-based approaches explicitly include abiotic or
biotic pattern-forming processes (i.e., landscape generators; Langhammer
et al. 2019; Salecker et al. 2019). Several earlier landscape generators
are based on cellular automata models and are able to simulate urban
growth (Clarke and Gaydos 1998) or deforestation (Soares-Filho et al.
2002). More recent landscape generators allow to simulate patchy
landscapes based on Gibbs processes (Gaucherel et al. 2006),
deforestation based on road and agricultural fields access (Pe'er et al.
2013), agricultural areas dominated by smallholders (Salecker et al.
2019), or vegetation surround watering points in semi-arid savanna
rangelands (combining pattern- and process-bases approaches; Hess et al.
2020).

\subsection{Individual-based models}\label{individual-based-models}

Individual-based models (or agent-based models) simulate discrete
entities that are described by attributes and behaviors and patterns
emerge from bottom-up interactions of individuals with each other and
their environment (DeAngelis and Grimm 2014). In landscape ecology
individual-based models are increasingly used to model especially
social-ecological systems (e.g, Carauta et al. 2018; Dislich et al.
2018; Gonzalez-Redin et al. 2019), but also disturbances (e.g., Seidl
and Rammer 2017; Spies et al. 2017; Kamimura et al. 2019) or
connectivity (e.g., Day et al. 2020). In order to facilitate future
model developments, recent progress includes adaptable modeling
frameworks (Schumaker and Brookes 2018) or reusable building block
(Berger et al. 2024). Furthermore, hybrid approaches that couple or even
integrated different model types with individual-based models could
benefit from rich development history or facilitate corresponding
strengths (O'Sullivan et al. 2016), e.g., linking an individual-based
and ecosystem model (Polhill et al. 2011).

\subsection{Digital twins}\label{digital-twins}

Digital Twins include three connected elements, namely a physical object
or system, its digital representation, and a data exchange between the
former two (Jones et al. 2020; De Koning et al. 2023) and there is an
increasing interest and use of them in both the industry and academia
(Jones et al. 2020). The need for timely and evidence-based decision
making in combination with increasing data availability makes them a
powerful tool for ecology (De Koning et al. 2023). Digital twins are
increasingly applied in agricultural landscapes research, including
topics such as crop and land cultivation, livestock farming, controlled
environment farming, or fertilization management (Cesco et al. 2023;
Purcell et al. 2023). Further applications include planning of rural
ecological landscapes (Tan and Cheng 2024), or exploration of
relationships between urban expansion and vegetation coverage (Zhao et
al. 2022). The use of general data processing, statistical and
mechanistic models, or artificial intelligence allows them to constantly
update the digital representation and analyze, visualize, or predict the
physical counterpart. Thus, Digital Twins can provide real-time state of
nature measurements, early detection of conservation trends,
relationships of ecosystem trends and environmental conditions, impact
assessments of interventions, or identify uncertainties and information
gaps (De Koning et al. 2023).

\section{Software and programming
languages}\label{software-and-programming-languages}

``Open science'' involves full transparency and data access at all
stages of the research processes and integrative and multi-disciplinary
fields such as ecology can massively benefit from this concept (Hampton
et al. 2015). Using open source software is one key aspect of open
science because it ensures transparency and consequently increases trust
in the analyses (Powers and Hampton 2019). Given the increasing data
availability and method complexity, future progress within the research
field will highly depend on available software and analysis tools
(Costanza et al. 2019). In this context, script-based workflows have an
advantage over workflows involving graphical user interfaces because the
former are more shareable and reproducible (Hampton et al. 2015; Powers
and Hampton 2019). Thus, we will focus the following section on
script-based open-source software suitable for landscape ecology.

The open-source, script-based R programming languages (R Core Team 2024)
was first released in 1995 (Smith 2016) with a focus on statistical
computing and data visualization. However, due to its extensions (also
called packages), the language is popular in many academic fields,
including ecology (Lai et al. 2019; Lortie et al. 2020), and it is
suitable for spatial data analysis and landscape ecology (e.g., Bivand
2020; Hesselbarth et al. 2021). Fundamental packages for spatial data
analysis include \emph{sf} for simple-features vector data (Pebesma
2018), \emph{terra} for raster data (Hijmans 2024), \emph{stars} for
spatiotemporal arrays, raster, and vector data cubes (Pebesma and Bivand
2023), and \emph{spatstat} for point pattern data (Baddeley et al.
2015). Several packages allow to create maps, such as \emph{tmap}
(Tennekes 2018) or \emph{ggplot2} (Wickham 2016). For a comprehensive
overview of packages related to geographical spatial data, please see
the CRAN Task View (Bivand and Nowosad 2024). R packages developed
specifically for spatial pattern analysis include, besides others,
\emph{landscapemetrics} (Hesselbarth et al. 2019), \emph{vectormetrics}
{[}still being developed; Matuszek et al. (2024){]}, \emph{motif}
(Nowosad 2021), \emph{rasterdiv} (Rocchini et al. 2021), or
\emph{geodiv} (Smith et al. 2021). Packages with a focus on scale
include e.g., \emph{multilandr} (Huais 2024) or \emph{grainchanger}
(Graham 2024). Connectivity analysis can be conducted using packages
including \emph{lconnect} (Mestre and Silva 2023), or \emph{grainscape}
(Chubaty et al. 2020). Furthermore, neutral landscapes can be simulated
using \emph{NLMR} (Sciaini et al. 2018), and the \emph{graph4lg} (Savary
et al. 2021) provides functions for landscape genetics.
