# Connectivity 

Connectivity describes how movement among resources patches is facilitated or hindered by landscape features such as types, amounts, and arrangement of LULC [@Taylor1993; @Taylor2006].
While structural connectivity focuses on physical and spatial relationships among resource patches, functional connectivity also includes the movement or flow of individuals and populations through the landscape [@Taylor2006].
Connectivity underpins ecosystem functionality and maintains biodiversity, and plays a large role in many conservation actions [@CorreaAyram2016; @Hilty2020].
Thus, in the past multiple approaches how to measure connectivity were developed [@Simpkins2018; @Keeley2021].

## Landscape metrics

- Many traditional lsm measure connectivity, e.g, ENN
- Recently, also focus in within-patch connectivity (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-019-00881-0)
