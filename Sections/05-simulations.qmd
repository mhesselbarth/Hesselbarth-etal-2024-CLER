# Simulation models

Simulation models are a powerful tool to study complex adaptive ecological systems in controllable, reproducible, and replicable settings [@Pascual2005; @Petrovskii2012].
Thus, they can be seen as experimental systems that allow, unlike to the natural world, all imaginable manipulations in order to advance theoretical developments or test hypotheses [@Peck2004].
Due to the usual temporal and spatial scales, complex interactions and feedbacks, or scale mismatches between patterns and processes, simulation models are one of the major approaches in landscape ecology [@Schroder2006; @Synes2016].
In general, simulations models can be classified using two major divisions, namely as *i)* predictive or exploratory models, and *ii)* pattern- or process-based models [@Peck2004;@Synes2016].
Here, we are going to focus mainly on exploratory models, but include both pattern- and process-based models.

## Landscapes simulators

Landscape simulators are typically used as null hypotheses, baselines, or scenarios because they allow to control certain aspects of the landscape [@Li2004; @Wang2008] and are generally simpler than ecological simulations models [@Hess2020].
Landscape simulators can be classified into two major categories, namely pattern-based and process-based approaches [@Peer2013; Langhammer2019].

Pattern-based approaches simulate landscapes without assuming any underlying abiotic or biotic processes [i.e., neutral landscape model\; @Gardner1987].
The earliest neutral models are based on percolation theory and assign LULC types randomly to cells in the landscape[@Gardner1987] or hierarchical models that consider different spatial scales while assigning cell values [@ONeill1992].
Landscapes characterized by continuous values can be simulated by fractal models, such as Brownian motion [@Palmer1992].
Borrowing from computer graphics, more recent neutral landscape models make use of spectral synthesis [e.g., Perlin noise\; @Etherington2022] or binary space partitioning [@Etherington2022a].
Neutral landscape models are also able to simulate landscapes dominated by anthropogenic activities using based on least-cost networks [@Etherington2024].
In order to ensure realistic neutral landscapes several approaches exist that use comparisons with real landscapes [@Inkoom2017] or are based on target values optimization [@VanStrien2016; @Justeau-Allaire2022].
<!-- In order to make multiple neutral landscape model algorithms accessible, several software libraries are available in prominent programming languages including Python [NLMpy\; @Etherington2015], R [NLMR\; @Sciaini2018], Julia (https://github.com/EcoJulia/NeutralLandscapes.jl), or GUI software (GradientLand, QRULE) -->

Contrastingly, processes-based approaches explicitly include abiotic or biotic pattern-forming processes [i.e., landscape generators\; @Langhammer2019; @Salecker2019].
Several earlier landscape generators are based on cellular automata models and are able to simulate urban growth [@Clarke1998] or deforestation [@Soares-Filho2002].
More recent landscape generators allow to simulate patchy landscapes based on Gibbs processes [@Gaucherel2006], deforestation based on road and agricultural fields access [@Peer2013], agricultural areas dominated by smallholders [@Salecker2019], or vegetation surround watering points in semi-arid savanna rangelands [combining pattern- and process-bases approaches\; @Hess2020].

## Individual-based models

Individual-based models (or agent-based models) simulate discrete entities that are described by attributes and behaviors and patterns emerge from bottom-up interactions of individuals with each other and their environment [@DeAngelis2014].
In landscape ecology individual-based models are increasingly used to model especially social-ecological systems [e.g, @Carauta2018; @Dislich2018; @Gonzalez-Redin2019], but also disturbances [e.g., @Seidl2017a; @Spies2017; @Kamimura2019] or connectivity [e.g., @Day2020].
In order to facilitate future model developments, recent progress includes adaptable modeling frameworks [@Schumaker2018] or reusable building block [@Berger2024].
Furthermore, hybrid approaches that couple or even integrated different model types with individual-based models could benefit from rich development history or facilitate corresponding strengths [@OSullivan2016], e.g., linking an individual-based and ecosystem model [@Polhill2011].
