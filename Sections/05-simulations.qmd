# Simulation models

Simulation models are a powerful tool to study complex adaptive ecological systems in controllable, reproducible, and replicable settings [@Pascual2005; @Petrovskii2012].
Thus, they can be seen as experimental systems that allow, unlike to the natural world, all imaginable manipulations in order to advance theoretical developments or test hypotheses [@Peck2004].
Due to the usual temporal and spatial scales, complex interactions and feedbacks, or scale mismatches between patterns and processes, simulation models are one of the major approaches in landscape ecology [@Schroder2006; @Synes2016].
In general, simulations models can be classified using two major divisions, namely as *i)* predictive or exploratory models, and *ii)* pattern- or process-based models [@Peck2004;@Synes2016].
Here, we are going to focus mainly on exploratory models, but include both pattern- and process-based models.

## Landscapes generators

Landscape generators are typically used as null hypotheses, baselines, or scenarios in landscape ecology analyses because they allow to control certain aspects of the landscape [@Li2004; @Wang2008] and are generally simpler as ecological simulations models [@Hess2020].
Landscape generators can be classified into two major categories, namely pattern-based and process-based approaches [@Peer2013].

Pattern-based landscape generators simulate landscape patterns without assuming any underlying abiotic or biotic processes [i.e., neutral landscape model\; @Gardner1987].
The earliest neutral models are based on percolation theory and assign LULC types randomly to cells in the landscape[@Gardner1987] or include hierarchical models that consider different spatial scales while assigning cell values [@ONeill1992].
Landscapes characterized by continuous values can be simulated by fractal models, such as Brownian motion [@Palmer1992].
Borrowing from computer graphics and being able to simulate hierarchical landscapes, more recent neutral landscape models make use of spectral synthesis [e.g., Perlin noise\; @Etherington2022] or Binary space partitioning [@Etherington2022a].
Neutral landscape models are also able to simulate landscapes dominated by anthropogenic activities, e.g., based on least-cost networks [@Etherington2024].
In order to ensure realistic landscapes, several approaches exist that use real landscapes [@Inkoom2017] or are based on target values optimization [@VanStrien2016; @Justeau-Allaire2022] to simulate neutral landscapes.
<!-- In order to make multiple neutral landscape model algorithms accessible, several software libraries are available in prominent programming languages including Python [NLMpy\; @Etherington2015], R [NLMR\; @Sciaini2018], or Julia (https://github.com/EcoJulia/NeutralLandscapes.jl). -->

Contrastingly, processes-based landscape generators explicitly include hypothesized pattern creating processes [@Langhammer2019; @Salecker2019].
