- Spatial patterns definitions in the literature (general; Dale 2000)
- Spatial patterns in many contexts (e.g. geography, biology, urban planning, medical studies) <!-- MH: I would at least cut the medical bit -->
- Spatial patterns in landscape ecology
  - Resolution, scale, and extent in spatial patterns
- Relation of spatial patterns and spatial (ecological?) processes
- Relation of spatial patterns to spatial processes is a golden grail of landscape ecology

- Spatial patterns in data (computational approach)
  - Limitations and considerations
- Data types <!-- MH: Could be moved to the individual sub-sections? -->
  - Raster data
  - Vector data: point, line, polygon
  - Point clouds 
  - Time series data
  - One variable vs. multivariable spatial patterns
  - Categorical vs. continuous spatial patterns

!what with fractals?
!ai and deep learning still seems to be underused in landscape ecology

## Landscape metrics
<!-- Hesselbarth -->

- Traditional approach to describe patterns
- Quantify categorical raster data (patch mosaic model)
- Quantify composition and configuration
- Widely applied since FRAGSTATS release
- Several alternative tools available and still widely used

## Surface metrics
<!-- Bosch, Hesselbarth -->
[Surface metrics])(https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-018-0685-1)

- More recent development
- Quantify continuous raster data (gradient surface models)
- More realistic representation of landscapes
- Based on molecular physics/medicine
- Not widely adopted yet (due to missing tools?)

## Entropy
<!-- Nowosad, Bosch -->
intro to entropy
various concepts:

- information (Shannon)/Shannon diversity
@Shannon1948
@nowosadInformationTheoryConsistent2019a

- thermodynamic (Boltzmann)

@Cushman2016
@cushmanGeneralizingBoltzmannConfigurational2021
@gaoComputationBoltzmannEntropy2019
@zhangCalculatingWassersteinMetricBased2020a
@stepinskiCurbYourEnthusiasm2022

- Kolmogorov, etc.; Juhász-Nagy’s information theory-based functions, Simpson index, Rao index, Pielou, Renyu, ...
@konradAdaptingMultiscaleApproach2023; 
@simpsonMeasurementDiversity1949


how they are related to each other
how they are related to spatial patterns and landscape ecology

entropy measures are still related to the underlining data representation

<!-- the need for open-source software in landscape ecology -->
<!-- every proposed method should be open-source and available to the community -->
