# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

Landscapes are typically defined in landscape ecology as mosaics of different land covers, habitats, ecosystems, or land use systems [@Forman1986LandscapeEcology; @Forman1995LandMosaics], with empathize on heterogeneity of at least one factor of interest [@Turner2015LandscapeEcology].
Linking spatial heterogeneity and ecological processes, including potential feedbacks, is the fundamental concept of landscape ecology [@Risser1984LandscapeEcology; @Turner1989LandscapeEcology; @Turner2005LandscapeEcology].

<!-- JN: the examples in the following section should be ordered in a similar way as the topics in the paper -->
Typical research topics include ecological flows in landscape mosaics, drivers and consequences of land use and land cover (LULC) change, nonlinear dynamics and landscape complexity, scale and scaling, spatial analysis and landscape modeling, pattern-process links, integrating humans and their activities into landscape ecology, landscape conservation and sustainability, or accuracy assessment and uncertainty analysis [@Wu2002KeyIssues; @Wu2013KeyConcepts].

Computational science analyzes abstracted core mechanisms of research questions using data and algorithms and is one of the most important tools of modern science [@Prlic2012TenSimple; @Wilson2014BestPractices].
Following, computational ecology can be defined as computational science that is used to address ecological research questions with focus on data-driven approaches and complex, adaptive systems [@Poisot2019DatabasedSynthesisdriven].
Computational ecology is crucial for the field because data is often context- and scale-dependent, making it challenging to design controllable, reproducible, and replicable experiments [@Petrovskii2012ComputationalEcology; but see @Wiersma2022ReviewLandscape].
Additionally, because landscape ecology is a cross-disciplinary field [including e.g., social sciences, geography, and ecology and evolution\; @Wiens1997MetapopulationDynamics; @With2019EssentialsLandscape], the general increase of data availability [@Chi2016BigData; @Jaric2020IEcologyHarnessing; @Wuest2020MacroecologyAge; @Nathan2022BigdataApproaches], or the complexity of landscape systems [@Newman2019ScalingComplexity], there is the need for advanced computational methods.

Here, we aim to introduce the latest developments of computational methods in landscape ecology.
However, we do not provide a systematic literature review, or a general introduction to (computational) landscape ecology.
Instead, for a more comprehensive, general introductions to landscape ecology, please see @Turner2015LandscapeEcology, @Gergel2017LearningLandscape, or @With2019EssentialsLandscape.
Here, we introduce recent computational developments in some important topics of landscape ecology including software that implements or is potentially capable of implementing these developments 
In this context, we are focusing on open-source software and specifically scripting languages such as R, Python, and Julia.
Lastly, we discuss potential future directions for the development of computational methods in landscape ecology.
