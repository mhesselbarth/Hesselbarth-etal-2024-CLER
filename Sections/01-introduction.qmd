# Introduction {#sec-introduction}

Landscapes are typically defined in landscape ecology as mosaics of different land covers, habitats, ecosystems, or land use systems [@Forman1986LandscapeEcology], with empathize on heterogeneity of at least one factor of interest [@Turner2015LandscapeEcology].
Linking spatial heterogeneity and ecological processes, including potential feedbacks, is the fundamental concept of landscape ecology [@Turner2015LandscapeEcology].
Typical research topics include, besides others, pattern-process links, landscape complexity, ecological flows, scale effects, landscape modeling, conservation, drivers and consequences of land use and land cover (LULC) change including human activities [@Wu2002KeyIssues; @Wu2013KeyConcepts].

Computational science analyzes abstracted core mechanisms of research questions using data and algorithms and is one of the most important tools of modern science [@Wilson2014BestPractices].
Following, computational ecology can be defined as computational science that is used to address ecological research questions with focus on data-driven approaches and complex, adaptive systems [@Poisot2019DatabasedSynthesisdriven].
Computational ecology is crucial for the field because data is often context- and scale-dependent, making it challenging to design controllable, reproducible, and replicable experiments [@Petrovskii2012ComputationalEcology; but see @Wiersma2022ReviewLandscape].
Additionally, because landscape ecology is a cross-disciplinary field [including e.g., social sciences, geography, and ecology and evolution\; @With2019EssentialsLandscape], the general increase of data availability [@Jaric2020IEcologyHarnessing], or the complexity of landscape systems [@Newman2019ScalingComplexity], there is the need for advanced computational methods.

Here, we aim to introduce the latest developments of computational methods in landscape ecology.
However, we do not provide a systematic literature review, or a general introduction to (computational) landscape ecology.
For a more comprehensive and general introductions to landscape ecology, please see @Turner2015LandscapeEcology, @Gergel2017LearningLandscape, or @With2019EssentialsLandscape.
Here, we introduce recent computational developments in some important topics of landscape ecology including software that implements or is potentially capable of implementing them.
In this context, we are focusing on open-source software and specifically scripting languages such as R, Python, and Julia.
