  abstract = {Background Applications of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics in landscape ecology are rare and poorly developed. This is a fundamental limitation given the centrally important role the second law plays in all physical and biological processes. A critical first step to exploring the utility of thermodynamics in landscape ecology is to define the configurational entropy of a landscape mosaic. In this paper I attempt to link landscape ecology to the second law of thermodynamics and the entropy concept by showing how the configurational entropy of a landscape mosaic may be calculated. Result I begin by drawing parallels between the configuration of a categorical landscape mosaic and the mixing of ideal gases. I propose that the idea of the thermodynamic microstate can be expressed as unique configurations of a landscape mosaic, and posit that the landscape metric Total Edge length is an effective measure of configuration for purposes of calculating configurational entropy. Conclusions I propose that the entropy of a given landscape configuration can be calculated using the Boltzmann equation. Specifically, the configurational entropy can be defined as the logarithm of the number of ways a landscape of a given dimensionality, number of classes and proportionality can be arranged (microstates) that produce the observed amount of total edge (macrostate).},

  abstract = {This paper presents a multivariate textual analysis of more than 1300 papers on entropy in ecology. There are six main insights that emerged. First, there is a large body of literature that has addressed some aspect of entropy in ecology, most of which has been published in the last 5--10 years. Second, the vast majority of these papers focus on species distribution, species richness, relative abundance or trophic structure and not landscape-scale patterns or processes, pe se. Third, there have been few papers addressing landscape-level questions related to entropy. Fourth, the quantitative analysis with hierarchical clustering identified a strongly nested structure among papers that addressed entropy in ecology. Fifth, there is clear differentiation of papers focused on landscapelevel applications of entropy from other papers, with landscape focused papers clustered together at each level of the hierarchy in a relatively small and closely associated group. Sixth, this group of landscape-focused papers was substructured between papers that explicitly adopted entropy measures to quantify the spatial pattern of landscape mosaics, often using variations on Boltzmann entropy, versus those that utilize Shannon entropy measures from information theory, which are not generally explicit in their assessment of spatial configuration. This review provides a comprehensive, quantitative assessment of the scope, trends and relationships among a large body of literature related to entropy in ecology and for the first time puts landscape ecological research on entropy into that context.},

Some of these methods appear to be fully thermodynamically consistent in their application to landscape patch mosaics, but none have been shown to be fully generalizable to all kinds of landscape patterns, such as point patterns, surfaces, and patch mosaics. The goal of this paper is to evaluate if the direct application of the Boltzmann relation is fully generalizable to surfaces, point patterns, and landscape mosaics. I simulated surfaces and point patterns with a fractal neutral model to control their degree of aggregation. I used spatial permutation analysis to produce distributions of microstates and fit functions to predict the distributions of microstates and the shape of the entropy function. The results confirmed that the direct application of the Boltzmann relation is generalizable across surfaces, point patterns, and landscape mosaics, providing a useful general approach to calculating landscape entropy.},

  abstract = {Ecological modelling should take its orientation more from real patterns observed in nature, than has been the case up to now, to overcome the deficiencies of the present strategies. Firstly, the orientation towards patterns provides guidelines about the manner and extent of the aggregation of biological information in the model. Modelling thereby loses much of its arbitrariness; secondly, pattern-oriented models are not `scale-free', i.e. they relate explicitly to spatial and temporal scales; and finally, they produce comparative predictions which are better suited for testing than the predictions achieved by models, which are only either complex or generalizing. To demonstrate the strategy of pattern-oriented modelling and its advantages, three examples from population ecology are presented: (1) In a model concerning density dependence and individual variability, the orientation towards a pattern in weight distributions requires explicit inclusion of the within-generation time scale in the model. (2) Orientation towards a pattern in the dispersal capabilities of small organisms leads to a metapopulation model, where environmental correlations about certain distances are taken into account. The survival of the metapopulation depends mainly on the ratio of the correlation distance to the range of dispersal of the organisms. (3) The wave-like pattern of the spread of rabies is reproduced by an extremely simple one-dimensional model, which is based on an extended cellular automaton approach. From this basic model, a description on finer spatial and temporal scales can be developed with the aim of constructing a model which allows for the investigation of spatial barriers against the spread of rabies. A comparison of the three example models shows that the main features of pattern-oriented models are generic. In producing comparative predictions which are related explicitly to scales, pattern-oriented modelling seems to be a strategy well suited to the `scaling up' from population ecology to community and ecosystem ecology.},

  abstract = {Among the most popular of metrics used to quantify landscape composition are Shannon's index, believed to emphasize the richness component of diversity, and Simpson's index, emphasizing the evenness component. These indices can show considerable variation in response to changes in landscape richness and evenness. However, the possibility of encountering opposite trends in the responses of these indices to assemblages that differ in only a single component of diversity has not been sufficiently acknowledged. An opposite response of these indices was observed for two Indian landscapes with the same richness, differing only in evenness. Using a numerical simulation, the likelihood of encountering landscapes with an opposite response was demonstrated to increase with increasing richness, from about 4\% for landscapes consisting of three cover types, to about 6\% for ten types. This emphasizes the need for caution when choosing an index of landscape diversity. Rare cover types provide habitats for sensitive species and facilitate critical ecological processes. The Shannon index, sensitive to their presence, is therefore recommended for landscape management within an ecological framework. Simpson's index, more responsive to the dominant cover type, can be used for specific situations where the dominant cover type is of interest, such as single-species reserve design.  2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Results In this study, we describe the software design of the tool, its capabilities, and present four case studies. They include calculation of spatial signatures based on land cover data for regular and irregular areas, search for regions with similar patterns of geomorphons, detection of changes in land cover patterns, and clustering of areas with similar spatial patterns of land cover and landforms.

  abstract = {The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication. A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic measure.},

Our review confirmed a major distinction between approaches rooted in the natural sciences and approaches rooted in the arts and the humanities. Three substantially different methodological approaches or strategies were identified: 1) `holistic' landscape character assessment approaches, by which visual perception and socio-cultural aspects of the landscape are emphasised; 2) landscape characterisation methods based on a priori selection of geo-ecological and land-use-related properties of the landscape; and 3) biophysical landscape characterisation approaches which rely strongly on statistical analyses in order to identify gradients of variation in the presence and/or abundance of landscape elements and properties. Assessment of landform and the composition of natural and human landscape elements was a central part of all of the reviewed methods. A trend towards increasing observer-independence over time was identified.},

  abstract = {We suggest that the conscious use of information that is ``hidden'' in distinct structures in nature itself and in data extracted from nature (=pattern) during the process of modeling (=pattern-oriented modeling) can substantially improve models in ecological application and conservation. Observed patterns, such as time-series patterns and spatial patterns of presence/absence in habitat patches, contain a great deal of data on scales, site-history, parameters and processes. Use of these data provides criteria for aggregating the biological information in the model, relates the model explicitly to the relevant scales of the system, facilitates the use of helpful techniques of indirect parameter estimation with independent data, and helps detect underlying ecological processes. Additionally, pattern-oriented models produce comparative predictions that can be tested in the field. We developed a step-by-step protocol for pattern-oriented modeling and illustrate the potential of this protocol by discussing three pattern-oriented population models: (1) a population viability analysis for brown bears (               Ursus               arctos               ) in northern Spain using time-series data on females with cubs of the year to adjust unknown model parameters; (2) a savanna model for detecting underlying ecological processes from spatial patterns of tree distribution; and (3) the incidence function model of metapopulation dynamics as an example of process integration and model generalization. We conclude that using the pattern-oriented approach to its full potential will require a major paradigm shift in the strategies of modeling and data collection, and we argue that more emphasis must be placed on observing and documenting relevant patterns in addition to attempts to obtain direct estimates of model parameters.},

In addition, it has been recently criticized to be thermodynamically irrelevant. Therefore, Boltzmann entropy was revisited, and methods have been developed for its calculation with landscape patterns. The latest method was developed based on the Wasserstein metric. This method incorporates spatial repetitiveness, leading to a Wasserstein metric-based Boltzmann entropy that is capable of capturing the configurational disorder of a landscape mosaic. However, the numerical work required to calculate this entropy is beyond what can be practically achieved through hand calculation. This study developed a new software tool for conveniently calculating the Wasserstein metric-based Boltzmann entropy. The tool provides a user-friendly human--computer interface and many functions. These functions include multi-format data file import function, calculation function, and data clear or copy function. This study outlines several essential technical implementations of the tool and reports the evaluation of the software tool and a case study. Experimental results demonstrate that the software tool is both efficient and convenient.},
