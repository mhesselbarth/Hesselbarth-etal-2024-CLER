  abstract = {This essay sheds new light on the meaning and measurement of compactness---one of the most intriguing and least-understood properties of geographic shapes. We articulate a unified theoretical foundation for the study of shape compactness that rests on two simple observations: First, that the circle is the most compact of shapes. And second, that there are 10---and possibly more---distinct geometrical properties of the circle that make it the most compact of shapes. We introduce these 10 properties, illustrate them with real-world examples and define indices associated with these properties that can be calculated using a geographic information system.},

  abstract = {Shape characterisation is important in many fields dealing with spatial data. For this purpose, numerous shape analysis and recognition methods with different degrees of complexity have so far been developed. Among them, relatively simple indices are widely used in spatial applications, but their performance has not been investigated sufficiently, particularly for building footprints (BFs). Therefore, this article focuses on BF shape characterisation with shape indices and classification schemes in a GIS environment. This study consists of four phases. In the first phase, the criteria for BF shape complexity were identified, and accordingly, benchmark data was constructed by human experts in three shape complexity categories. In the second phase, 18 shape indices were selected from the literature and automatically computed in GIS. The performance of these indices was then statistically assessed with histograms, correlation matrix and boxplots, and consequently four indices were found to be appropriate for further investigation. In the third phase, two new indices (Equivalent Rectangular index and Roughness index) were proposed with the objective to measure some BF shape characteristics more efficiently. The proposed indices also were found to be appropriate with the same statistical assessment procedures. In the final phase, BF shape complexity categories were created with the pairs of six appropriate indices and four choropleth mapping classification schemes (equal intervals, natural break, standard deviation, and custom) in GIS. The performance of the index--scheme pairs was assessed against the benchmark data. The findings demonstrated that both new indices and two of the selected indices (Convexity and Rectangularity) delivered higher performance. The custom classification scheme was found more ideal to reveal absolute shape complexity with the index value ranges derived from the boxplots while the other classification schemes were more appropriate to reveal relative shape complexity.},

Over the past years, principles of information theory have been applied to many environmental and ecological studies. However, it still appears that the initial concept of entropy as identified by Shannon's initial contribution cannot be directly applied to evolving geographical systems. The research introduced in this paper suggests an extension of the concept of entropy to the spatial and temporal dimensions, by taking into account the distribution of entities in space and time. We propose a series of entropy measures that together form a set of complementary indices to evaluate the distribution of entities, events and categories in space and time. The whole approach is exemplified by several illustrative configurations.},

  abstract = {Background Applications of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics in landscape ecology are rare and poorly developed. This is a fundamental limitation given the centrally important role the second law plays in all physical and biological processes. A critical first step to exploring the utility of thermodynamics in landscape ecology is to define the configurational entropy of a landscape mosaic. In this paper I attempt to link landscape ecology to the second law of thermodynamics and the entropy concept by showing how the configurational entropy of a landscape mosaic may be calculated. Result I begin by drawing parallels between the configuration of a categorical landscape mosaic and the mixing of ideal gases. I propose that the idea of the thermodynamic microstate can be expressed as unique configurations of a landscape mosaic, and posit that the landscape metric Total Edge length is an effective measure of configuration for purposes of calculating configurational entropy. Conclusions I propose that the entropy of a given landscape configuration can be calculated using the Boltzmann equation. Specifically, the configurational entropy can be defined as the logarithm of the number of ways a landscape of a given dimensionality, number of classes and proportionality can be arranged (microstates) that produce the observed amount of total edge (macrostate).},

  abstract = {This paper presents a multivariate textual analysis of more than 1300 papers on entropy in ecology. There are six main insights that emerged. First, there is a large body of literature that has addressed some aspect of entropy in ecology, most of which has been published in the last 5--10 years. Second, the vast majority of these papers focus on species distribution, species richness, relative abundance or trophic structure and not landscape-scale patterns or processes, pe se. Third, there have been few papers addressing landscape-level questions related to entropy. Fourth, the quantitative analysis with hierarchical clustering identified a strongly nested structure among papers that addressed entropy in ecology. Fifth, there is clear differentiation of papers focused on landscapelevel applications of entropy from other papers, with landscape focused papers clustered together at each level of the hierarchy in a relatively small and closely associated group. Sixth, this group of landscape-focused papers was substructured between papers that explicitly adopted entropy measures to quantify the spatial pattern of landscape mosaics, often using variations on Boltzmann entropy, versus those that utilize Shannon entropy measures from information theory, which are not generally explicit in their assessment of spatial configuration. This review provides a comprehensive, quantitative assessment of the scope, trends and relationships among a large body of literature related to entropy in ecology and for the first time puts landscape ecological research on entropy into that context.},

Some of these methods appear to be fully thermodynamically consistent in their application to landscape patch mosaics, but none have been shown to be fully generalizable to all kinds of landscape patterns, such as point patterns, surfaces, and patch mosaics. The goal of this paper is to evaluate if the direct application of the Boltzmann relation is fully generalizable to surfaces, point patterns, and landscape mosaics. I simulated surfaces and point patterns with a fractal neutral model to control their degree of aggregation. I used spatial permutation analysis to produce distributions of microstates and fit functions to predict the distributions of microstates and the shape of the entropy function. The results confirmed that the direct application of the Boltzmann relation is generalizable across surfaces, point patterns, and landscape mosaics, providing a useful general approach to calculating landscape entropy.},

Previous studies have demonstrated that finer spatial resolution products are more suited to monitoring urban vegetation than coarse spatial resolution datasets. However, there are differences in the generation of fine spatial resolution datasets that could affect how urban vegetation is represented. To explore how sensitive monitoring and analysis tasks are to the choice of vegetation dataset, a series of comparative analyses were undertaken using three fine spatial resolution datasets in Perth, Western Australia. A technique for quantitative comparison of spatial pattens was used to compare vegetation datasets. There were large areas of Perth where spatial patterns of vegetation were substantially different across datasets. The level of differences in spatial patterns between datasets varied with geographic context such as land use. Elements of a spatial pattern related to grass and tree composition were similar across datasets but there were differences in how shrubs and the configuration of vegetation features were captured. There were differences in the temporal change detection of vegetation patterns across datasets. Spatial patterns of vegetation and land cover generated using the three datasets were used as predictor variables of surface temperatures in machine learning workflows. In some cases, the models learned dataset specific relationships between elements of a vegetation pattern and surface temperature outcomes. In a final modelling analysis, spatial patterns of vegetation were considered as an outcome responding to a disturbance event, a change in dwelling density. The size of the effect of dwelling density change on vegetation patterns varied across vegetation datasets.},

  abstract = {Ecological modelling should take its orientation more from real patterns observed in nature, than has been the case up to now, to overcome the deficiencies of the present strategies. Firstly, the orientation towards patterns provides guidelines about the manner and extent of the aggregation of biological information in the model. Modelling thereby loses much of its arbitrariness; secondly, pattern-oriented models are not `scale-free', i.e. they relate explicitly to spatial and temporal scales; and finally, they produce comparative predictions which are better suited for testing than the predictions achieved by models, which are only either complex or generalizing. To demonstrate the strategy of pattern-oriented modelling and its advantages, three examples from population ecology are presented: (1) In a model concerning density dependence and individual variability, the orientation towards a pattern in weight distributions requires explicit inclusion of the within-generation time scale in the model. (2) Orientation towards a pattern in the dispersal capabilities of small organisms leads to a metapopulation model, where environmental correlations about certain distances are taken into account. The survival of the metapopulation depends mainly on the ratio of the correlation distance to the range of dispersal of the organisms. (3) The wave-like pattern of the spread of rabies is reproduced by an extremely simple one-dimensional model, which is based on an extended cellular automaton approach. From this basic model, a description on finer spatial and temporal scales can be developed with the aim of constructing a model which allows for the investigation of spatial barriers against the spread of rabies. A comparison of the three example models shows that the main features of pattern-oriented models are generic. In producing comparative predictions which are related explicitly to scales, pattern-oriented modelling seems to be a strategy well suited to the `scaling up' from population ecology to community and ecosystem ecology.},

  abstract = {Geospatial Pattern Analysis Toolbox (GeoPAT) is a collection of GRASS GIS modules for carrying out pattern-based geospatial analysis of images and other spatial datasets. The need for pattern-based analysis arises when images/rasters contain rich spatial information either because of their very high resolution or their very large spatial extent. Elementary units of pattern-based analysis are scenes --patches of surface consisting of a complex arrangement of individual pixels (patterns). GeoPAT modules implement popular GIS algorithms, such as query, overlay, and segmentation, to operate on the grid of scenes. To achieve these capabilities GeoPAT includes a library of scene signatures -- compact numerical descriptors of patterns, and a library of distance functions -- providing numerical means of assessing dissimilarity between scenes. Ancillary GeoPAT modules use these functions to construct a grid of scenes or to assign signatures to individual scenes having regular or irregular geometries. Thus GeoPAT combines knowledge retrieval from patterns with mapping tasks within a single integrated GIS environment. GeoPAT is designed to identify and analyze complex, highly generalized classes in spatial datasets. Examples include distinguishing between different styles of urban settlements using VHR images, delineating different landscape types in land cover maps, and mapping physiographic units from DEM. The concept of pattern-based spatial analysis is explained and the roles of all modules and functions are described. A case study example pertaining to delineation of landscape types in a subregion of NLCD is given. Performance evaluation is included to highlight GeoPAT's applicability to very large datasets. The GeoPAT toolbox is available for download from http://sil.uc.edu/.},

  abstract = {We introduce landscape similarity --- a numerical measure that assesses affinity between two landscapes on the basis of similarity between the patterns of their constituent landform elements. Such a similarity function provides core technology for a landscape search engine --- an algorithm that parses the topography of a study area and finds all places with landscapes broadly similar to a landscape template. A landscape search can yield answers to a query in real time, enabling a highly effective means to explore large topographic datasets. In turn, a landscape search facilitates auto-mapping of physiographic units within a study area. The country of Poland serves as a test bed for these novel concepts. The topography of Poland is given by a 30 m resolution DEM. The geomorphons method is applied to this DEM to classify the topography into ten common types of landform elements. A local landscape is represented by a square tile cut out of a map of landform elements. A histogram of cell-pair features is used to succinctly encode the composition and texture of a pattern within a local landscape. The affinity between two local landscapes is assessed using the Wave-Hedges similarity function applied to the two corresponding histograms. For a landscape search the study area is organized into a lattice of local landscapes. During the search the algorithm calculates the similarity between each local landscape and a given query. Our landscape search for Poland is implemented as a GeoWeb application called TerraEx-Pl and is available at http://sil.uc.edu/. Given a sample, or a number of samples, from a target physiographic unit the landscape search delineates this unit using the principles of supervised machine learning. Repeating this procedure for all units yields a complete physiographic map. The application of this methodology to topographic data of Poland results in the delineation of nine physiographic units. The resultant map bears a close resemblance to a conventional physiographic map of Poland; differences can be attributed to geological and paleogeographical input used in drawing the conventional map but not utilized by the mapping algorithm.},

This study aimed to quantitatively characterize land-use classes using shape metrics. The study was conducted in a case area located in southern China, covering 12 scenes of SPOT-5 images. There were a total of 10 metrics selected for the analysis: convexity (CONV), solidity (SOLI), elongation (ELONG), roundness (ROUND), rectangular fitting (RECT), compactness (COMP), form factor (FORM), square pixel metric (SqP), fractal dimension (FD), and shape index (SI). The last five metrics were used to measure the complexity of shape. Six land-use classes were investigated in the case area: roads; cultivated lands; settlements; rivers; ponds; and forest and grass lands. The results showed that all the typical shape properties of the land-use segments can be well measured by shape metrics. We identified the land-use classes whose values were significantly differentiated from the other classes for each metric. Finally, we selected five shape metrics (SOLI, ELONG, ROUND, RECT, FORM) by visual comparison and statistical analysis of the metrics values, and deduced the ``shape metric signatures'' (SMS) of the different land-use classes. SMS were found to be accurate and predictive discriminators of land-use classes within the study area. Our results showed that SMS can clearly distinguish spectrally similar land-use classes. The results of this study will help to build a more accurate and intelligent object-oriented classification system for land-use classes.},

  abstract = {Land-cover mapping is one of the foundations of Earth science. As a result of the combined efforts of many scientists, numerous global land-cover (GLC) products with a resolution of 30\,m have so far been generated. However, the increasing number of fine-resolution GLC datasets is imposing additional workloads as it is necessary to confirm the quality of these datasets and check their suitability for user applications. To provide guidelines for users, in this study, the recent developments in currently available 30\,m GLC products (including three GLC products and thematic products for four different land-cover types, i.e., impervious surface, forest, cropland, and inland water) were first reviewed. Despite the great efforts toward improving mapping accuracy that there have been in recent decades, the current 30\,m GLC products still suffer from having relatively low accuracies of between 46.0\% and 88.9\% for GlobeLand30-2010, 57.71\% and 80.36\% for FROM\_GLC-2015, and 65.59\% and 84.33\% for GLC\_FCS30-2015. The reported accuracies for the global 30\,m thematic maps vary from 67.86\% to 95.1\% for the eight impervious surface products that were reviewed, 56.72\% to 97.36\% for the seven forest products, 32.73\% to 98.3\% for the six cropland products, and 15.67\% to 99.7\% for the six inland water products. The consistency between the current GLC products was then examined. The GLC maps showed a good overall agreement in terms of spatial patterns but a limited agreement for some vegetation classes (such as shrub, tree, and grassland) in specific areas such as transition zones. Finally, the prospects for fine-resolution GLC mapping were also considered. With the rapid development of cloud computing platforms and big data, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) greatly facilitates the production of global fine-resolution land-cover maps by integrating multisource remote sensing datasets with advanced image processing and classification algorithms and powerful computing capability. The synergy between the spectral, spatial, and temporal features derived from multisource satellite datasets and stored in cloud computing platforms will definitely improve the classification accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution of fine-resolution GLC products. In general, up to now, most land-cover maps have not been able to achieve the maximum (per class or overall) error of 5\%--15\% required by many applications. Therefore, more efforts are needed toward improving the accuracy of these GLC products, especially for classes for which the accuracy has so far been low (such as shrub, wetland, tundra, and grassland) and in terms of the overall quality of the maps.},

  abstract = {Geographic shape compactness is of cancern in such contexts as urban morphology, political districting, and accuracy of enumeration unit values. The purpose of the present paper is to campare, categorize, and evaluate the various methods suggesled for measuring compactness. Review of suggesled rompactness indices resulted in the identification of four categories, based upon: l) perimeter-area measurement, 2) single parameters of related circles, 3) direct romparison to a standard shape, and 4) dispersion of elements of a shape's area. In all, eleven indices were calculated for a sample of U.S. counties and their frequency distributions were compared. Additionally, similarities and differences in the units of high, median, and low rompactness were identified. Within each category, indices exhibited ronsiderable similarity while significant differences were evident from category to category. These differences suggesled variation in accuracy with which the indices measure rompactness. It was hypothesized that messures based upon dispersion of elements of a shape's area would provide the most accurate measure because they ronsider the shape as a whole while the other indices do not. Determination of the accuracy with which each index measures rompactness supporled this hypothesis. lndices based upon direct romparison to a standard shape were found to be of similar accuracy and, therefore, also judged to be suitable compactness measures. Those measures based upon perimeter-area measurement and single parameters of related circles were determined to be considerably less accurate messures of compactness.},

  abstract = {Among the most popular of metrics used to quantify landscape composition are Shannon's index, believed to emphasize the richness component of diversity, and Simpson's index, emphasizing the evenness component. These indices can show considerable variation in response to changes in landscape richness and evenness. However, the possibility of encountering opposite trends in the responses of these indices to assemblages that differ in only a single component of diversity has not been sufficiently acknowledged. An opposite response of these indices was observed for two Indian landscapes with the same richness, differing only in evenness. Using a numerical simulation, the likelihood of encountering landscapes with an opposite response was demonstrated to increase with increasing richness, from about 4\% for landscapes consisting of three cover types, to about 6\% for ten types. This emphasizes the need for caution when choosing an index of landscape diversity. Rare cover types provide habitats for sensitive species and facilitate critical ecological processes. The Shannon index, sensitive to their presence, is therefore recommended for landscape management within an ecological framework. Simpson's index, more responsive to the dominant cover type, can be used for specific situations where the dominant cover type is of interest, such as single-species reserve design.  2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Land is a natural resource that humans have utilized for life and various activities. Land use/land cover change (LULCC) has been of great concern to many countries over the years. Some of the main reasons behind LULCC are rapid population growth, migration, and the conversion of rural to urban areas. LULC has a considerable impact on the land-atmosphere/climate interactions. Over the past two decades, numerous studies conducted in LULC have investigated various areas of the field of LULC. However, the assemblage of information is missing for some aspects. Therefore, to provide coherent guidance, a literature review to scrutinize and evaluate many studies in particular topical areas is employed. This research study collected approximately four hundred research articles and investigated five (5) areas of interest, including (1) LULC definitions; (2) classification systems used to classify LULC globally; (3) direct and indirect changes of meta-studies associated with LULC; (4) challenges associated with LULC; and (5) LULC knowledge gaps. The synthesis revealed that LULC definitions carried vital terms, and classification systems for LULC are at the national, regional, and global scales. Most meta-studies for LULC were in the categories of direct and indirect land changes. Additionally, the analysis showed significant areas of LULC challenges were data consistency and quality. The knowledge gaps highlighted a fall in the categories of ecosystem services, forestry, and data/image modeling in LULC. Core findings exhibit common patterns, discrepancies, and relationships from the multiple studies. While literature review as a tool showed similarities among various research studies, our results recommend researchers endeavor to perform further synthesis in the field of LULC to promote our overall understanding, since research investigations will continue in LULC.},

A local landscape arises from a fusion of patterns of natural themes (such as land cover, landforms, etc.), which makes an unsupervised identification and mapping of LTs difficult. This paper introduces the integrated co-occurrence matrix (INCOMA) -- a signature for numerical representation of multi-thematic categorical patterns. INCOMA enables an unsupervised identification and mapping of LTs. The region is tessellated into a large number of local landscapes -- patterns of themes over small square-shaped neigh\- borhoods. With local landscapes represented by INCOMA signatures and with dissimilarities between local landscapes calculated using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), LTs can be identified and mapped using standard clustering or segmentation techniques. Resultant LTs are typically heterogeneous with respect to categories of contributing themes reflecting the human perception of a landscape. LTs calculated by INCOMA are more faithful abstractions of actual landscapes than LTs obtained by the current method of choice -- the map overlay. The concept of INCOMA is described, and its application is demonstrated by an unsupervised mapping of LT zones in Europe based on com\- bined patterns of land cover and landforms.},

This work scrutinizes binary classes mapped onto regular grids and counts the relative frequencies of all first-order configuration components and then converts these measurements into empirical probabilities of occurrence for either of the two landscape classes. The approach takes into consideration configuration explicitly and composition implicitly (in a common framework), while the construction of a frequency distribution provides a generic model of landscape structure that can be used to simulate structurally similar landscapes or to compare divergence from other landscapes. The technique is first tested on simulated data to characterize a continuum of landscapes across a range of spatial autocorrelations and relative compositions. Subsequent assessments of boundary prominence are explored, where outcomes are known a priori, to demonstrate the utility of this novel method. For a binary map on a regular grid, there are 32 possible configurations of first-order orthogonal neighbours. The goal is to develop a workflow that permits patterns to be characterized in this way and to offer an approach that identifies how relatively divergent observed patterns are, using the well-known Kullback--Leibler divergence.},

A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject. In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. If the number of messages in the set is finite then this number or any monotonic function of this number can be regarded as a measure of the information produced when one message is chosen from the set, all choices being equally likely. As was pointed out by Hartley the most natural choice is the logarithmic function. Although this definition must be generalized considerably when we consider the influence of the statistics of the message and when we have a continuous range of messages, we will in all cases use an essentially logarithmic measure.},

Multivariate statistical analyses revealed segregation of the approaches according to the landscape concept applied, the degree of observer independence and various other factors involved in the landscape characterisation process. Our review confirmed a major distinction between approaches rooted in the natural sciences and approaches rooted in the arts and the humanities. Three substantially different methodological approaches or strategies were identified: 1) `holistic' landscape character assessment approaches, by which visual perception and socio-cultural aspects of the landscape are emphasised; 2) landscape characterisation methods based on a priori selection of geo-ecological and land-use-related properties of the landscape; and 3) biophysical landscape characterisation approaches which rely strongly on statistical analyses in order to identify gradients of variation in the presence and/or abundance of landscape elements and properties. Assessment of landform and the composition of natural and human landscape elements was a central part of all of the reviewed methods. A trend towards increasing observer-independence over time was identified.},

Switzerland has the ambitious objective of being a sustainable country while remaining an attractive business location with a high level of well-being. However, this aspiration is hampered by increasing pressures that are significantly impacting the environment and putting serious demands on land. In the present study, we used the national Land Cover (LC) dataset, named ArealStatistik, produced by the Federal Statistical Office, to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of Land Cover in Switzerland, providing a comprehensive assessment of land cover change at the national scale. Results indicate that, in general, Switzerland has undergone small, spatially dispersed, dynamic, and gradual change trends, with high rates of transition between low growing Brush Vegetation and forest LC classes in recent years. These pixel-level trends are more important in the lower altitude plateau and Jura regions, while greater changes in the spatial configuration of LC are observed in the alpine regions. However, findings also suggest that identifying drivers and understanding the rate of change are limited by the spatial resolution and temporal update frequency of the ArealStatistik. The ability to understand these drivers would benefit from a high-resolution annual LC dataset. Such a data product can be produced using the ArealStatistik together with dense satellite data time-series and Machine/Deep Learning techniques.},

Methods for spatial-temporal analyses are becoming increasingly important for ecological studies.

Several ecological topics in which geographic in.formation systems (GIS) can play an important role (landscape pattern analysis, neutral models of pattern and process, and extrapolation across spatial scales) are reviewed. To study the relationship between observed landscape patterns and ecological processes, a neutral model approach is recommended. For example, the expected pattern (i.e., neutral model) of the spread of disturbance across a landscape can be generated and then tested using actual landscape data that are stored in a GIS. Observed spatial or temporal patterns in ecological data may also be influenced by scale. Creating a spatial data base frequently requires integrating data at different scales. Spatial scale is shown to influence landscape pattern analyses, but extrapolation of data across spatial scales may be possible if the grain and extent of the data are specified. The continued development and testing of new methods for spatial-temporal analysis will contribute to a general understanding of landscape dynamics.},

  abstract = {Landscapes were mapped as clusters of 2 or 3 land cover** types, based on their pattern within the clusters and tendency for a single type to dominate. These landscapes, called Landscape Pattern Types (LPTs), were combined with other earth surface feature data in a Geographic Information System (GIS) to test their utility as analysis units. Road segment density increased significantly as residential and urbanized land cover components increased from absent, to present as patch, to present as matrix (i.e., the dominant land cover type). Stream segment density was significantly lower in LPTs with an urbanized or residential matrix than in LPTs with either a forest or agriculture matrix, suggesting an inverse relationship between stream network density and the prevalence of human development other than agriculture in the landscape. The ratio of average forest patch size to total forest in the LPT unit decreased as agriculture replaced forest, then increased as residential and urban components dominated. Wetland fractal dimension increased as agriculture and residential land cover components of LPTs increased. Comparison of LPT and LUDA land cover area statistics in ecoregions suggested that land cover data alone does not provide information as to its spatial arrangement.},

  abstract = {We suggest that the conscious use of information that is ``hidden'' in distinct structures in nature itself and in data extracted from nature (=pattern) during the process of modeling (=pattern-oriented modeling) can substantially improve models in ecological application and conservation. Observed patterns, such as time-series patterns and spatial patterns of presence/absence in habitat patches, contain a great deal of data on scales, site-history, parameters and processes. Use of these data provides criteria for aggregating the biological information in the model, relates the model explicitly to the relevant scales of the system, facilitates the use of helpful techniques of indirect parameter estimation with independent data, and helps detect underlying ecological processes. Additionally, pattern-oriented models produce comparative predictions that can be tested in the field. We developed a step-by-step protocol for pattern-oriented modeling and illustrate the potential of this protocol by discussing three pattern-oriented population models: (1) a population viability analysis for brown bears (               Ursus               arctos               ) in northern Spain using time-series data on females with cubs of the year to adjust unknown model parameters; (2) a savanna model for detecting underlying ecological processes from spatial patterns of tree distribution; and (3) the incidence function model of metapopulation dynamics as an example of process integration and model generalization. We conclude that using the pattern-oriented approach to its full potential will require a major paradigm shift in the strategies of modeling and data collection, and we argue that more emphasis must be placed on observing and documenting relevant patterns in addition to attempts to obtain direct estimates of model parameters.},

  abstract = {Currently, raster-based landscape indices (LIs) that measures the landscape pattern of raster-format land-use data, can be easily computed by relevant software (e.g., Fragstats). Unfortunately, open-access software for vector-based LIs often implement a small variety of metrics, which cannot meet the growing demand of the GIS and landscape design research. The common approach often results in a loss of accuracy. Hence, this paper presents the state-of-the-art VecLI framework for computing 217 vector-based LIs. A parcel merging algorithm is proposed to address the impact of landscape fragmentation on vector-based LIs by considering the neighborhood effect. A case study was conduct in Shunde, China. The result shows that 80\% of the LIs from VecLI are strongly correlated to Fragstats's LIs. The patch perimeter-related metrics from VecLI portray a more realistic geographical pattern compared to those from Fragstats. Moreover, the VecLI-based software is developed for use by the GIS and landscape design researchers.},

  abstract = {Shannon entropy is currently the most popular method for quantifying the disorder or information of a spatial data set such as a landscape pattern and a cartographic map. However, its drawback when applied to spatial data is also well documented; it is incapable of capturing configurational disorder. In addition, it has been recently criticized to be thermodynamically irrelevant. Therefore, Boltzmann entropy was revisited, and methods have been developed for its calculation with landscape patterns. The latest method was developed based on the Wasserstein metric. This method incorporates spatial repetitiveness, leading to a Wasserstein metric-based Boltzmann entropy that is capable of capturing the configurational disorder of a landscape mosaic. However, the numerical work required to calculate this entropy is beyond what can be practically achieved through hand calculation. This study developed a new software tool for conveniently calculating the Wasserstein metric-based Boltzmann entropy. The tool provides a user-friendly human--computer interface and many functions. These functions include multi-format data file import function, calculation function, and data clear or copy function. This study outlines several essential technical implementations of the tool and reports the evaluation of the software tool and a case study. Experimental results demonstrate that the software tool is both efficient and convenient.},
