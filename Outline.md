# Outline
- Introduction (**Hesselbarth**)
  - Brief introduction of landscape ecology
  - Definition of computational methods
  - Computational aspects of landscape ecology
  - Purpose of this paper
- Spatial patterns

- Optimization 
  - *MH: maybe rather include in several existing sections?*
- Spatial planning (**Jung**)
- *?* Landscape genetics (**Breitbart?**)
- Software and programming language for landscape ecology
  - *?* Open source vs. proprietary software
    - *MH: Only very brief, mention that both exists*
  - *?* GUI vs. script based software
    - *MH: Similar as above, only brief mention that both exit*
  - Programming language
    - R (**Hesselbarth**, **Nowosad?**)
    - Python (**Bosch**, **Jung?**)
    - Julia
- Discussion
  - Future needs
