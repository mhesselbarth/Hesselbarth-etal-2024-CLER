# General
1. Please feel free to add or re-arrange topics to the outline. This is work-in-progress and not set in stone.
2. Please feel free to add your name to a (sub-) section as lead. Of course multiple people can work on one section.
3. Please feel free to add general comments, remarks, etc. (using your initials).

# Outline
- Introduction (**Hesselbarth**)
  - Brief introduction of landscape ecology
  - Definition of computational methods
  - Computational aspects of landscape ecology
  - Purpose of this paper
- Spatial patterns
  - Landscape metrics (**Hesselbarth**)
  - Vector metrics (**Nowosad**, **Hesselbarth**)
  - Surface metrics (**Bosch**, **Hesselbarth?**)
  - Entropy (**Nowosad**, **Bosch**)
  - Landscape Mosaic (**Bosch**)
- Connectivity / Movement / Dispersal (**Schouten**)
- Sampling (and aggregation?) in landscape ecology (**Bosch**)
- Simulations and models
  - Neutral landscape (**Hesselbarth**)
  - Process-based simulation (**Schouten**, **Hesselbarth**)
- Optimization 
  - *MH: maybe rather include in several existing sections?*
- Spatial planning (**Jung**)
- Landscape genetics (**Breitbart?**)
- Software and programming language for landscape ecology
  - *?* Open source vs. proprietary software
    - *MH: Only very brief, mention that both exists*
  - *?* GUI vs. script based software
    - *MH: Similar as above, only brief mention that both exit*
  - Programming language
    - R (**Hesselbarth**, **Nowosad?**)
    - Python (**Bosch**, **Jung?**)
    - Julia (**Schouten**)
- Discussion
  - Future needs

## Currently missing but maybe interesting
- Artificial intelligence impacts on landscape ecology
- More processes focused section(s)

# General comments
- Include more general debates in the field if we can connect them to computational methods (e.g., habitat amount vs fragmentation)
- Generally, structure to first show was currently available and used, followed by what could be missing
