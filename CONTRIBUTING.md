# Contributing to Hesselbarth-etal-CLER

-   Remember to pull before starting to work!
-   Please write one sentence per line so changes can be easily tracked in *git*.
-   For each section, there is a separate `quarto` file in the `Sections/` folder. At the beginning of the file and/or sub-section, put down your name as responsible person (as a comment).
-   The final manuscript will be rendered at the end using the `Manuscript.qmd` file.
-   Try to write informative commit messages (mine will become increasingly passive-aggressive over time :))
-   Please indicate comments to already written text using your initial, e.g., `\<!-- MH: This needs a reference \-->`.
-   Please add all references to the `.bib.` file trying to be as consistent as possible. (MH will try to keep this file as tidy as possible)
-   For bigger discussions, open an [issue](https://github.com/r-spatialecology/Hesselbarth-etal-CLER/issues).
-   Please be nice and respectful :)
-   If code is required, it should loosely follow the `tidyverse` [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org) (well...at least as close as possible)
