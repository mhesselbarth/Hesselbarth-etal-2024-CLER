# Contributing to Hesselbarth-etal-CLER

-   Remember to pull first thing.

-   Please write one sentence per line so changes can be easily tracked in *git*.

-   Try to write informative commit messages (mine will become increasingly passive-aggressive over time :))

-   Please indicate comments to already written text using your initial, e.g., \<!-- MH: This needs a reference \-->.

-   Please add all references to the `.bib.` file in alphabetical order trying to be as consistent as possible.

-   For bigger discussions, open an [issue](https://github.com/r-spatialecology/Hesselbarth-etal-CLER/issues).

-   Please be nice and respectful :)

-   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org) (well...at least as close as possible)
